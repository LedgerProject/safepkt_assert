# SafePKT assert

This project is implemented in the context of the European [NGI LEDGER program](https://ledger-3rd-open-call.fundingbox.com/).

This component is an assertion library aiming at facilitating test automation based on a symbolic execution approach  
facilitated by SafePKT primitives developed in the larger context of  software verification tools targeting rust-based programs,  
and based on the work of [project-oak/rust-verification-tools](https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools) project.

See [SafePKT description](https://ledgerproject.github.io/home/#/teams/SafePKT)
